So like many of the first posts on many of my other blogs, this is the last time! Why do I say that this time? I have no idea, this can't be the last time. The issue is, I can't find the "perfect" set up without having to roll my own. I want to combine "twitter":https://twitter.com/#!/jcblitz, "Tumblr":http://tumble.blitzstein.net/, read it later, google reader, and a few other web apps along with original content I can type in the blog itself in the manner I want. So far I haven't found one system that can do this. I've played with Jekyll a while a go and it had a lot of promise. I don't really need a "dynamic" site as a lot of data I'm interested in displaying comes off site. JavaScript can handle most of it.  

I'm going to give this a whirl and see if I can bend it to do what I want. My thought is I want columns that can aggregate each of those data items. Lets see if I can make that happen.
