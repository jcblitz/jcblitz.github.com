I've joined the ranks of the masses by finally purchasing an iPad 3 (or a _new iPad_ if you follow the apple marketing machine). I've recognized I wanted a tablet now for about 2 months and came up with some minimal use cases on why I should actually get one. 

* I've been reading more non technical books in 2012 and my wife has a decent sized .epub collection (she has a nook simple). I would like to leverage and build on that.
* I've been coming across some technical .epub publications that I would like to read. For instance, [backbone.js](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3831954) and [Exceptional Ruby](http://exceptionalruby.com/)
* Reading on my computer sucks. I've tried it before when publishers started releasing PDFs for their books. 
* I need to stay focused on why I'm on my computer, which is generally to program or business related. I get easily distracted with "Let me check twitter real quick" or "Anything on Google+?". This usually leads me down a road of "Oh, that looks interesting" and just like that, I lose focus. I would like to separate these activities, as well as separate machines. 

So basically my goal is to keep my laptop centered on work, and my tablet centered on play. I'm not under the illusion that my iPad will help me be more productive with work, I don't even see that as a use case. If I remove distractions from work, and work from my distractions, I think this will lead me down the road of being more productive. Lets face it, I've been working on [ClosedReq](http://www.closedreq.com) for far too long. 

iPad apps I've settled on:

* Flipboard (this is my primary app since it's my primary use case)
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Read It Later
* iBooks
* Netflix
